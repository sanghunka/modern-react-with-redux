# Section 1:Let's Dive In!

## 5. Critical Questions

1. So what's React all about?

    React (1) displays HTML and (2) changes that HTML when the user does something.

- How do we tell React to show HTML? `JSX`
- React Components
    - Functions that return JSX (stuff that looks like HTML)
    - Tells React what to show on the screen
    - A project can have many components that work together

JSX(The stuff that looks like HTML) tells React to...
- Tell React to create a normal HTML element
    - `<div></div>`
    - `<button>Click</button>`
    - `<input type="text" />`
- Tell React to show another componet
    - `<Field />`
    - `<Languages />`
    - `<Translate />`
